# BICOM SYSTEM


## INTRODUCTION
The extension of a unidirectional RKE system to a bidirectional RKE system is known as a BiCom system. The RKE delivers a radio wave to the receiver at a specific frequency, and the vehicle authenticates the fob by sending back the status. This project provides an overview of BiCom systems, covering their functional design and requirements, as well as their analysis and implementation on a variety of levels.
